# Assignment: Image Classification and Performance

## Overview
In this assignment, you will explore image classification in greater depth by comparing different classification models on the **Caltech101 dataset**. Additionally, you will analyze the memory utilization and performance of two common numerical representations: 32-bit floating-point and 16-bit floating-point.

---

## Objectives
1. Understand and compare image classification models on a real-world dataset.
2. Measure classification accuracy across different models.
3. Analyze memory utilization and performance for different numerical representations.

## Part 2: Assignment Instructions
1. Open the Colab notebook:  
   [Image Classification Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AkzKZJ75IN2YK2OmdeA2c1gVfIxbx2O_#scrollTo=w7K4akKygMJv?copy=true).
2. Work through the notebook and complete the **10 questions** (numbered and bolded).
3. During the assignment, you will:
   - Compare image classification models on the Caltech101 dataset.
   - Measure and report classification accuracy.
   - Analyze memory utilization and performance for 32-bit and 16-bit floating-point representations.

## Part 3: Submission Instructions
1. After completing the notebook:
   - Export it as a PDF by navigating to **File > Print > Adobe PDF** in Colab.
   - Save the PDF file with the name `image_classification_performance.pdf`.
2. Provide a link to your Colab solution in case the PDF does not fully display your work.
3. Commit and push the following to your GitHub Classroom repository:
   - The exported PDF (`image_classification_performance.pdf`).
   - A text file or README update containing the link to your Colab notebook.

## Notes and Tips
1. **Do Not Procrastinate**:
   - Google may limit your GPU usage if you exceed their quota. If this happens:
     - Close all open Colab notebooks and wait up to 24 hours for GPU access to reset.
     - Alternatively, use a secondary Google account to continue your work.
2. **Best Practices**:
   - Test and compare models thoroughly before submitting.
   - Document your observations and insights in the notebook.
